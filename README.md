This project is a Meetings Reminder app using ReactJS. 

I have used basic logic to retrieve data from an array of objects in data file using useState.

This app has three different functions to display and clear our meeting scheduals from the browser. Also, I added a new function using useEffect to prevent retrieve the data when refreshing the browser.
